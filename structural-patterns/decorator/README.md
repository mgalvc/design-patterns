# Decorator

- Allows you to couple new behaviors to objects by putting them inside the objects that implement these behaviors
- Solves inheritance limitations:
  - Inheritance is static, object can't change it's behavior at runtime
  - Subclasses can have only a single parent
- Useful when it's not possible to extend behavior using only inheritance
